            The objects of the Co-operative are specifically restricted to carry on the business as a co-operative……
        </item>

        <title>POWERS</title>

        <item>
            To further its objects the Co-operative may do all such lawful things as may further the Co-operative's objects and,

        <title>MEMBERSHIP</title>

        <item>
            The first Members of the Co-operative will be the subscribers to the memorandum of association of the

        </item>

        <item-with-children marker-type="loweralpha">
            <item>All Employees on taking up employment with the Co-operative may be admitted to membership of the Co-operative,
                    except that the Co-operative in a general meeting may by a majority vote decide to exclude from membership:</item>

            <child-item>
                <item>Newly appointed Employees during such reasonable probationary period as may be specified
                            in their terms and conditions of employment;</item>

            In accordance with the Co-operative Principle of voluntary and open membership, whilst the Co-operative shall
            undertake to encourage its Employees to become Members, membership must be voluntary and as a result cannot
            be a condition of employment.
